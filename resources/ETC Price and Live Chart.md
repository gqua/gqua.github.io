The table above highlights ETC's volatility across different timeframes. Short-term fluctuations are common in cryptocurrencies, but ETC's historical significance and community-driven development provide long-term stability.  

### Current Market Metrics  
- **Market Cap**: $2.53 billion  
- **Trading Volume (24H)**: $187,106  
- **Circulating Supply**: 152,569,957 ETC  
- **Max Supply**: 210,700,000 ETC  

ETC's capped supply model mirrors Bitcoin's scarcity principle, potentially driving value as adoption grows.  

## Ethereum Classic Price Prediction: Key Influencers  

While precise ETC price predictions are speculative, several factors influence its trajectory:  

1. **Market Sentiment**: Positive developments like partnerships or technological upgrades can boost investor confidence.  
2. **Network Security**: Post-2019 51% attacks, ETC implemented the MESS protocol, raising attack costs and restoring trust.  
3. **Adoption Rates**: Increased use in decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts could drive demand.  
4. **Competitive Landscape**: ETC's proof-of-work (PoW) model differentiates it from Ethereum's proof-of-stake (PoS) system, attracting miners post-The Merge.  
5. **Macroeconomic Trends**: Inflation and global economic shifts often impact crypto valuations.  

## Why Ethereum Classic Stands Out  

### Decentralization and Immutability  

ETC adheres strictly to the original Ethereum blockchain principles, resisting ledger modifications even during crises like The DAO hack. This commitment appeals to purists valuing censorship resistance.  

### Security Enhancements  

The MESS (Modified Exponential Subjective Scoring) solution has fortified ETC against future 51% attacks by making them economically unfeasible.  

### Mining Opportunities  

As Ethereum transitioned to PoS, ETC emerged as a primary PoW alternative, offering miners a sustainable platform. This shift has redirected mining resources toward ETC, enhancing network security and hash rate.

## ETC vs. ETH: A Comparative Analysis  

| Feature               | Ethereum (ETH)                | Ethereum Classic (ETC)       |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Consensus Mechanism** | Proof-of-Stake (PoS)          | Proof-of-Work (PoW)          |
| **Philosophy**        | Innovation and scalability    | Immutability and decentralization |
| **Market Cap**        | $200+ billion                 | $2.53 billion                |
| **Upgrades**          | Frequent                      | Conservative                 |

While ETH dominates in adoption and market capitalization, ETC's niche appeal lies in its ideological rigidity and mining accessibility.  

## How to Mine Ethereum Classic
