# Coinbase Q1 Profits Plummet Despite Revenue Growth: Adds $153M Bitcoin Holdings Amid $597M Unrealized Loss

## Strategic Bitcoin Investment Amid Market Volatility

Coinbase has revealed its Q1 financial performance, demonstrating resilience in revenue generation despite significant market turbulence. While the digital asset exchange reported a 24% year-over-year revenue increase to $2 billion, net income fell sharply by 94% to $65.6 million. This divergence highlights the challenges of operating in a sector characterized by extreme price fluctuations.

The company's strategic decision to double down on Bitcoin investments during this volatile period merits close examination. Coinbase allocated an additional $153 million to crypto assets during Q1, primarily focused on BTC accumulation. This bold move reflects the exchange's confidence in Bitcoin's long-term value proposition, even while acknowledging the immediate financial impact through a $597 million unrealized loss on their crypto holdings.

Their innovative USDC Boosted Rewards program now offers up to 12% APY on USDC holdings within perpetual contract portfolios, capped at $1 million.
