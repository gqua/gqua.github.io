## What Is the Spot Grid Bot?  

The **Spot Grid bot** automates trades by setting price boundaries. It sells assets when prices hit upper grid lines and buys when prices drop to lower lines. Users can:  
- Manually define grid parameters  
- Use AI-driven strategies based on historical data  

**FAQ: How does the Spot Grid bot handle volatile markets?**  
The AI strategy adapts to volatility by adjusting grid spacing, reducing risks during sharp price swings.  

## What Is the Futures Grid Bot?  

The **Futures Grid bot** operates on perpetual futures contracts with leverage. It supports three modes:  
1. **Long**: Profits from rising prices  
2. **Short**: Benefits from declining markets  
3. **Neutral**: Balances buys and sells around a central price  

**Risk Note**: Leverage amplifies both gains and losses. Beginners should start with low leverage (e.g., 2xâ€“5x).  

## What Is the Spot DCA (Martingale) Bot?  

The **Spot DCA bot** automates dollar-cost averaging by buying assets at intervals. Features include:  
- Flexible start conditions using technical indicators  
- Continuous trading cycles with safety orders  
- Minimum initial fund requirements  

**Example**: If BTC drops from $30k to $25k, the bot buys more at $28k and $26k, averaging the cost to $27k.  

## What Is the Dip Sniper Bot?  

The **Dip Sniper bot** secures discounted assets during market dips. It guarantees partial order execution at the lowest price within a set timeframe.  

**Use Case**: Set a target price for ETH below $1,800. Even if the price only dips to $1,850, the bot executes a portion of your order at the lowest point.  

## What Is the Peak Sniper Bot?  

The **Peak Sniper bot** locks in profits at price peaks. It sells assets partially at the highest observed price during a defined period, ensuring you capture gains even if the market reverses.  

## What Is the Smart Portfolio Bot?  

The **Smart Portfolio bot** rebalances assets based on predefined allocations. Two modes include:  
- **Scheduled**: Rebalances at set intervals  
- **Proportional**: Triggers rebalancing when asset allocations deviate by a user-defined percentage (e.g., 5%)  

**Example**: A portfolio with 50% BTC, 25% ETH, and 25% SOL rebalances if BTC rises to 60% of total holdings.  

## What Is the Recurring Buy Bot?  

The **Recurring Buy bot** automates DCA strategies for up to 20 cryptocurrencies. It supports purchases via USDT or credit/debit cards, ideal for long-term investors.  

## What Is the Arbitrage Bot?  

The **Arbitrage bot** capitalizes on price differences between spot and futures markets. Two modes include:  
1. **Funding Rate Mode**: Profits from perpetual swap funding rates  
2. **Spread Arbitrage Mode**: Exploits price gaps between futures contracts  

**Risk Note**: Requires understanding of delta-neutral strategies and market dynamics.  

## What Are Iceberg Orders?  

**Iceberg Orders** split large trades into smaller chunks to avoid market slippage. Traders set:  
- Maximum order size per chunk  
- Tolerable slippage (as a percentage or absolute value)  

## What Is the TWAP Bot?  

The **TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) bot** executes large orders over a set period. Itâ€™s ideal for minimizing market impact during high-volume trades.
