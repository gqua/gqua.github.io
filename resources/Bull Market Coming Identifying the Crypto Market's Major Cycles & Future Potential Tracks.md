## Understanding Crypto Market Cycles  

### Bitcoin Halving Mechanics  
Every 210,000 blocks (~4 years), miner rewards are cut by 50%. This deflationary mechanism historically precedes bull runs:  

| Halving Event | Price Low | 12-Month High | % Gain |
|---------------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| 2012          | $2.99     | $1,150        | +38,000% |
| 2016          | $650      | $19,800       | +2,900% |
| 2020          | $4,800    | $64,800       | +1,250% |

However, post-2024 halving volatility highlights changing market dynamics influenced by institutional adoption and macroeconomic policies.

## 🔍 Frequently Asked Questions  

**1. What distinguishes a bull market from a bear market?**  
Bull markets show sustained price increases (>20% from recent lows) with strong volume and positive sentiment. Bear markets feature declines >20%, capitulation phases, and reduced trading activity.  

**2. How reliable are technical indicators like ZMET?**  
These tools provide probabilistic insights rather than certainties. Combining multiple metrics improves accuracy - for instance, ZMET's 78% success rate in predicting 2023 market phases.  

**3. Is institutional adoption affecting traditional cycle patterns?**  
Yes. ETF approvals and corporate treasury allocations create structural demand, potentially reducing volatility and extending accumulation phases.  

**4. Which sectors show strongest growth potential?**  
AI-integrated blockchains, decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN), and regulated tokenized assets are key areas to watch.
