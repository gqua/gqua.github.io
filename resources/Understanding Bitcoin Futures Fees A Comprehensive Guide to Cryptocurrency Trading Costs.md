## Bitcoin Futures Fee Calculation Explained

Trading fees on platforms like OKX, Binance, and Huobi depend on several factors:

- **Order Type**: 
  - Maker orders (limit orders): 0.02% fee
  - Taker orders (market orders): 0.05% fee
- **Leverage**: Higher leverage amplifies both gains and fees
- **Position Size**: Larger positions incur proportionally higher fees

Using 10x leverage with a 1 BTC position:
- Maker fee: 0.0002 BTC (0.02% of 1 BTC)
- Taker fee: 0.0005 BTC (0.05% of 1 BTC)

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why do taker fees exceed maker fees?**
