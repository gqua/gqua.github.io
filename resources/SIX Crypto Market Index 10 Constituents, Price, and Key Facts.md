# SIX Crypto Market Index 10: Constituents, Price, and Key Facts

## Understanding the SIX Crypto Market Index 10

The **SIX Crypto Market Index 10** serves as a benchmark for measuring the performance of the largest and most liquid crypto assets. Designed to provide investors with a reliable reference point, this index tracks the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, offering insights into market trends and investment opportunities. Below, we explore its methodology, selection criteria, and unique value proposition.

### Core Components and Selection Criteria

To maintain relevance and accuracy, the index employs strict inclusion rules:

1. **Market Capitalization Requirement**: Eligible assets must maintain an average market cap of **$1 billion or more** over 30 days.
2. **Liquidity Threshold**: Minimum average daily trading volume of **$500,000** over 30 days ensures tradability.
3. **Review Process**: Constituents are reviewed quarterly on the third Friday of each calendar quarter.

These criteria ensure the index reflects the most significant and tradable assets in the crypto market. The top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are selected, weighted proportionally to their size.

### Historical Context and Calculation Methodology

Launched on **December 30, 2016**, with a base value of **1,000 points**, the index transitioned to continuous calculation on **January 9, 2018**. Prices are aggregated from multiple exchanges to mitigate single-source bias and enhance reliability. This multi-source approach reduces volatility caused by exchange-specific anomalies, ensuring a robust benchmark.

### Key Features of the Index

- **Transparency**: Constituent lists and methodology details are publicly accessible.
- **Diversification**: Exposure to a basket of top-tier cryptocurrencies rather than single-asset risk.
- **Investability**: Designed for use in financial products like ETFs, futures, and structured notes.

## Index Performance and Use Cases

### Tracking Market Trends

The index provides a macro view of the crypto market, helping investors gauge sector-wide movements. By tracking the top 10 assets, it balances exposure between established cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) and emerging players.

### Applications for Investors

- **Portfolio Benchmarking**: Compare returns of crypto portfolios against a standardized benchmark.
- **Risk Management**: Assess systemic risks in the crypto market through aggregated performance metrics.
- **Product Development**: Serve as the foundation for derivatives and passive investment vehicles.

## Constituent Breakdown and Weightings

While specific constituents change quarterly, the index typically includes:

| Rank | Cryptocurrency | Approximate Weighting (%) | Key Features |
|------|----------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| 1    | Bitcoin (BTC)  | 40-50                     | Largest market cap, decentralized store of value |
| 2    | Ethereum (ETH) | 20-30                     | Smart contract platform, DeFi ecosystem |
| 3-10 | Altcoins       | 20-30 combined            | Includes assets like Binance Coin, Solana, etc. |

Weightings adjust quarterly based on market capitalization, ensuring the index remains representative of the market structure.

### Seasonal Adjustments and Rebalancing

Quarterly rebalancing on the third Friday of each month allows the index to adapt to market dynamics. New entrants must surpass the $1B market cap and $500K liquidity thresholds to replace lower-ranked assets.

## Why the SIX Crypto Market Index 10 Stands Out

- **Core Holding**: Allocate a portion of crypto exposure to the index for diversified risk.
- **Tactical Adjustments**: Use the index as a benchmark to identify outperforming or undervalued assets.
