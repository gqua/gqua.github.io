## Ripple‚Äôs Strategic Investment and Expansions  

Ripple‚Äôs participation as an early investor highlights its commitment to expanding XRP‚Äôs institutional footprint. This partnership follows Ripple‚Äôs recent $1.25 billion acquisition of **Hidden Road**, a prime brokerage platform, which positions the company to enhance its infrastructure for institutional clients.  

Notably, Hidden Road recently secured a **broker-dealer license** from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a critical step in offering compliant, scalable services to institutional investors.  

## XRP‚Äôs Role in Cross-Border Payments  

XRP‚Äôs utility extends beyond speculative investment. Its **XRPL blockchain** serves as a foundational layer for cross-border payments, mirroring the use cases of stablecoins like **Tether (USDT)**. According to Standard Chartered, stablecoin transactions have grown 50% annually over the past two years, with projections of a 10x increase by 2029.  

Geoff Kendrick, Head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, notes:  
> ‚ÄúXRP is uniquely positioned at the heart of one of the fastest-growing uses for digital assets ‚Äì facilitation of cross-border and cross-currency payments. This bodes well for XRPL‚Äôs throughput growth, given the similar use cases for stablecoins and XRPL.‚Äù  

Standard Chartered further predicts that **XRP could surpass Ethereum by 2028**, driven by demand for efficient payment solutions and global trade digitization.  

## ETF Developments and Regulatory Landscape  

The institutional XRP ecosystem is gaining momentum with advancements in **exchange-traded funds (ETFs)**. In the U.S., **Teucrium Investment Advisors** recently launched the first leveraged XRP ETF (XXRP) on NYSE Arca. Meanwhile, **Grayscale** and **21Shares** await U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval for their spot XRP ETFs, with decisions expected by October 2025.  

Ripple‚Äôs ongoing legal dispute with the SEC also shows signs of resolution. A recent court motion granted a 60-day extension to finalize settlement talks, reducing regulatory uncertainty for XRP investors.
