## Understanding Oscillator Divergence  

Oscillator divergence occurs when price action and momentum indicators move in opposite directions, signaling potential trend reversals. For example:  
- **Bullish divergence**: Price forms lower lows, but the oscillator forms higher lows.  
- **Bearish divergence**: Price forms higher highs, but the oscillator forms lower highs.

### Key Oscillators for Divergence Analysis  
1. **Stochastic**: Measures closing price relative to its high-low range.  
2. **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Tracks overbought/oversold conditions.  
3. **TSI (True Strength Index)**: Combines double smoothing for trend confirmation.  
4. **CCI (Commodity Channel Index)**: Identifies cyclical trends.  
5. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**: Highlights shifts in momentum.  
6. **Stochastic RSI**: Adds sensitivity to RSI signals.

## Program 62: All-in-One Divergence Detection Tool  

Program 62 is a TradeStation indicator designed to detect divergences across multiple oscillators. It consolidates functionalities from previous programs (27, 28, 30, 42, 60) into a single interface, supporting charts like Renko, Kagi, and tick-based systems.  

### Key Features:  
- **Customizable Oscillator Selection**: Choose from 6 oscillators and 16 sub-options (e.g., Stochasticâ€™s oFastK vs. oSlowD).  
- **Dynamic Pivot Comparison**: Stores historical pivot data to identify divergences across multiple timeframes.  
- **Visual Alerts**: Draws trendlines and ellipses to highlight potential reversal zones.  

#### Supported Oscillator Configurations  
| Input Value | Oscillator Type       | Sub-Option               |  
|-------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|  
| 1â€“3         | Stochastic            | oFastK, oFastD, oSlowD   |  
| 4â€“6         | MACD                  | MACD, Signal, Histogram  |  
| 7â€“8         | RSI                   | RSI, RSI Average         |  
| 9â€“12        | CCI                   | Standard, Fast, Smoothed |  
| 13â€“14       | TSI                   | TSI, TSI Average         |  
| 15â€“16       | Stochastic RSI        | StochRSI, SmoothSRSI     |

### How Program 62 Works  

1. **Pivot Detection**: Uses left/right strength parameters (default: 3/2) to identify swing highs/lows.  
2. **Divergence Validation**: Compares price pivots with oscillator pivots within a user-defined bar tolerance (default: 3 bars).  
3. **Visual Feedback**:  
   - **Trendlines**: Drawn between confirmed divergences (colors: green for bullish, red for bearish).  
   - **Ellipses**: Mark pivot zones (customizable fill/border colors).

## Practical Applications Across Markets  

Program 62 adapts to various instruments and timeframes:  
- **Forex**: EURUSD line break charts for intraday setups.  
- **Indices**: S&P 500 daily scans for long-term reversals.  
- **Futures**: @ES (S&P 500 E-mini) 3-minute charts for scalping.  

**Example**: On a 5-minute @YM (Dow Jones) chart, enabling the CCI option highlights divergences between price action and smoothed CCI values, offering entry signals near support/resistance levels.

## Customizing Program 62 for Optimal Performance  

Adjust key inputs based on market conditions:  
- **MaxArraySize (3)**: Limits historical pivots compared (max: 5).  
- **BarTol (3)**: Relaxes/strictens pivot alignment tolerance.  
- **Oscillator Parameters**: Fine-tune lengths (e.g., RSI 10-period vs. 14-period).  

**Color Customization**: Use high-contrast hues (e.g., yellow fill with orange borders) for better visibility on complex charts.

### FAQs  

**Q: Which oscillator is best for divergence trading?**  
A: Stochastic RSI works well in ranging markets, while MACD suits trending environments. Test combinations using Program 62â€™s multi-oscillator interface.  

**Q: Can Program 62 work on MetaTrader platforms?**  
A: Noâ€”itâ€™s exclusive to TradeStation 9.1+. For MultiCharts users, separate integrations are required.  

**Q: How to avoid false divergence signals?**  
A: Combine with volume analysis or trend filters. Program 62â€™s array-based comparison reduces false positives by validating against multiple historical pivots.  

**Q: Does divergence always lead to reversals?**  
A: No. Divergence indicates weakening momentum, not guaranteed reversals. Always use risk management tools like stop-loss orders.  

**Q: Whatâ€™s the difference between MACD and TSI?**  
A: MACD focuses on moving average crossovers, while TSI uses double-smoothed price data for trend confirmation.

## Oscillator Deep Dive  

### 1. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**  
Developed by Welles Wilder, RSI oscillates between 0â€“100. Overbought (>70) and oversold (<30) zones help identify exhaustion points.  

### 2. **MACD**  
The difference between 12-period and 26-period EMAs, with a 9-period signal line for crossovers. Histogram spikes signal accelerating momentum.  

### 3. **Stochastic**  
Formula: `%K = (Current Close - Lowest Low) / (Highest High - Lowest Low) * 100`. FastK (raw) vs. SlowD (smoothed) impacts sensitivity.  

### 4. **TSI (True Strength Index)**  
Calculates momentum using double-smoothed price changes. Blauâ€™s formula:  
```  
TSI = 100 * (EMA(EMA(Î”Price, 25), 13)) / (EMA(EMA(|Î”Price|, 25), 13))  
```  

### 5. **Commodity Channel Index (CCI)**  
Lambertâ€™s CCI measures deviation from average price:  
```  
CCI = (Typical Price - SMA) / (0.015 * Mean Deviation)  
```

## Risk Disclaimer  

All technical indicators, including Program 62, carry risks. Divergence signals should never be used in isolation. Always backtest strategies and combine with price action analysis.
