## Understanding Public-Key Cryptography

Public-key cryptography, also known as asymmetric encryption, uses mathematically linked key pairs to secure digital communications. The **private key** must remain secret, while the **public key** can be shared freely. This system enables critical blockchain functions:
- **Transaction Signing**: Proving ownership without revealing the private key
- **Wallet Address Generation**: Creating unique identifiers for cryptocurrency storage
- **Data Encryption**: Secure peer-to-peer communication

🔑 **Core Keywords**: Public-key cryptography, blockchain security, digital signature

## RSA Algorithm: Foundations and Implementation

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) remains one of the most widely adopted asymmetric encryption systems. Its security stems from the computational difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.

### Key Generation Process

1. **Prime Selection**: Choose two large prime numbers *p* and *q*
2. **Modulus Calculation**: Compute *n = p × q* and *z = (p-1)(q-1)*
3. **Public Exponent Selection**: Find *e* where 1 < e < z and gcd(e,z) = 1
4. **Private Key Derivation**: Solve for *d* where (e×d) ≡ 1 mod z
5. **Key Distribution**: Public key = (*n*, *e*), Private key = (*n*, *d*)

### Encryption and Decryption Workflow

- **Encryption**: *c ≡ m^e mod n* (Using recipient's public key)
- **Decryption**: *m ≡ c^d mod n* (Using private key)

The security of RSA depends on the key length, with 2048-bit keys currently considered the minimum standard for most applications.

## Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)

Bitcoin and many modern blockchains utilize ECDSA for its efficiency advantages. This algorithm leverages elliptic curve mathematics to achieve equivalent security with shorter key lengths.

### Key Generation in ECDSA

1. **Private Key**: Randomly generated 256-bit integer (*d*)
2. **Public Key**: Calculated as *Q = d × G* (Where *G* is curve base point)
3. **Bitcoin Implementation**: Uses secp256k1 curve parameters

|----------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Key Size       | 2048 bits      | 256 bits          |
| Signing Speed  | 0.5 ms         | 2.1 ms            |
| Verification   | 0.1 ms         | 0.7 ms            |
| Security Level | 112 bits       | 128 bits          |

💡 **Core Keywords**: ECDSA, blockchain transaction security, cryptographic key management

## FAQs: Public-Key Cryptography in Blockchain

**Q: Why does Bitcoin use ECDSA instead of RSA?**  
A: ECDSA offers equivalent security with shorter keys (256-bit vs 3072-bit RSA), resulting in faster transactions and lower storage requirements.

**Q: Can I recover funds if I lose my private key?**  
A: No. Private keys are irrecoverable by design - this immutability is fundamental to blockchain security.

**Q: How often should cryptographic keys be rotated?**  
A: Best practices recommend rotation every 2-3 years, or immediately if any compromise is suspected.

**Q: What's the difference between wallet addresses and public keys?**  
A: Wallet addresses are hashed versions of public keys, providing an additional security layer against potential ECDSA vulnerabilities.

**Q: Is quantum computing an immediate threat?**  
A: Current quantum computers lack sufficient qubits to break ECDSA, but proactive migration to post-quantum algorithms is recommended.
