While DAI aims to maintain a $1 valuation, temporary deviations occur due to:
- **Market demand/supply imbalances**
- **Gas fees on Ethereum (DAI's primary blockchain)**
- **Interest rate changes in MakerDAO's collateral system**
- **Global crypto market sentiment**

DAI's peg is reinforced through arbitrage opportunities: traders buy DAI when it dips below $1 and sell when it rises above, incentivizing price normalization.
