## What Are Micro Futures Contracts?  
Micro futures are smaller-sized futures contracts designed to make derivatives trading more accessible to individual investors. Unlike standard futures, which often require substantial capital and margin, micro futures allow traders to speculate on price movements with reduced financial commitment.  

### Key Features of Robinhood's Micro Futures:  
- **Lower Margin Requirements**: Enables participation with minimal upfront investment.  
- **Trading Ladder Interface**: Streamlines order execution for improved user experience.  
- **Contract Specifications**:  
  | Cryptocurrency | Contract Size | Approximate Value (USD) |  
  |----------------|---------------|-------------------------|  
  | XRP            | 2,500 XRP     | $5,200                  |  
  | Solana (SOL)   | 2,500 SOL     | $5,200                  |
